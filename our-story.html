          <h2>My mission</h2>
          <p>Encharmed started because I wanted jewelry to feel personal without feeling intimidating or overpriced. Traditional charm bars can be beautiful, but they are often so expensive that customization becomes a luxury instead of something people can do just because it is fun. My mission is to make memorable, customizable jewelry accessible to more people through pieces that feel meaningful, giftable, and truly personal without the premium price tag.</p>
          <p>Student entrepreneurship is a huge part of why Encharmed exists. Through Student-Made at ASU and the campus creator community, I have been able to grow Encharmed in a space that values creativity, experimentation, and building something from scratch. Student-Made gives me a place to list products, but this website is where I can share the story behind the brand, explain the full pop-up charm studio experience, and connect with customers who are interested in custom requests, collaborations, or bulk orders.</p>
          <p>At pop-ups, the goal is not just to sell jewelry. It is to create a moment. Choosing charms, building a piece on the spot, and walking away with something that represents your people or a memory is the whole point. Encharmed is about making those moments easy to access, whether you are buying for yourself, gifting to a friend, or ordering for an event.</p>
          <p class="note">Most Encharmed pieces are built at pop-ups where customers can choose charms and see the piece come together on the spot.</p>
